    // into their head that this could be optimized by instead calling pthread_mutex_init
    // just once and then using sslLocks.initialize to copy that init-ed mutex into each
    // element of the array.
    //
    // This developer, much like Icarus, has flown too close to the sun. You see,
    // IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 doesn't define assignment or equality for pthread_mutex_t. This
    // means that, for example, a pthread_mutex_t could be just a reference to a heap-allocated
    // structure that handles the actual locking. If this were the case, copying the init-ed
    // mutex would lead us to have an array of "locks" all of which are actually aliased copies
    // of the same lock. It seems to me that this would be unlikely to go well. For this reason
